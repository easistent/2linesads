CHANGELOG
=========

* 0.1 (2006)

	* This was the first version writen just to prove a point and tested for 1 year on medium traffic site selling ads and collection stats. It was ugly, but it worked well enought.

* 0.2 (2006-11-07)

	* Introduced AJAX + JSON in 2linesads.js. Before there was a separate PHP script that generated the javascript call. Now it does not work in IE7 and less. Not a problem, really.
	* This is the first published version.
